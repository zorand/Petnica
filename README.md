###This is readme for 3dsimul

This program was developed in 7 days no sleep environment, mostly between
swimming, basketball, playing games, exploring the great mud cave, great
frog lake, and other nature beauties, in RC Petnica (high school research
center near Valjevo, Yugoslavia) back in summer 1991. It's very buggy, but
works, sometimes. Learned C.

Hint : press <d> when you start simulation.
